Gmail Setup

For authentication, you'll have to do either of two things:

    Generate an application-specific password for your Google Account (your only option if you're using 2FA),
    Turn on less-secure app access (not an option with 2FA)

In gmail, go click the gear icon, go to Settings, go to the tab Forwarding POP/IMAP, and click the Configuration instructions link in IMAP Access row.

Then click I want to enable IMAP. At the bottom of the page, under the paragraph about configuring your mail client, select Other. Note the mail server information and use that information for further settings as shown in the next section.
